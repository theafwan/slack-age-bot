## Setting up the slack bot environment 
In main.go, replace the strings ```"Replace_with_Bot_token_here"``` and ```"Replace_with_socket_token_here"``` below with your specific tokens.
```go 
os.Setenv("SLACK_BOT_TOKEN", "Replace_with_Bot_token_here") // Token from Oauth & Permissions
```
```go
os.Setenv("SLACK_APP_TOKEN", "Replace_with_socket_token_here") //socket token. The channel ID in the slack channel of the workspace
```
1. To find your token, you need to got to api.slack.com/apps. Press ```create new app``` and choose ```From scratch```, name you app with your worspace you are admin to.
2. Choose ```Socket Mode``` in the left menu and enable socket mode. Give a name for the socket/app token. Replace this token with the ```Replace_with_socket_token_here``` above in the code.

    - ```app_mention```
    - ```channels:history```
